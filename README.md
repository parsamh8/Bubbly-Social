Heres a [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xi2nPvWCBrTdXrDoWHzAJo5vqzafGetr/view) to step by step demonstration.


1. **Server Initialization and Database Syncing:**
   - Launch the application with a single command to start the server.
   - Automatically sync Mongoose models with the MongoDB database for seamless NoSQL data management.

2. **API Interaction via Insomnia:**
   - **GET Routes:**
     - Retrieve user and thought data in a structured JSON format for easy verification and debugging.
   - **POST, PUT, and DELETE Routes:**
     - Perform CRUD operations to create, update, and delete users and thoughts, ensuring smooth database interactions.

3. **Reaction and Friendship Management:**
   - **POST and DELETE Routes:**
  
     - Use GET routes to retrieve user and thought data in formatted JSON:

        GET /api/users
        GET /api/thoughts

4. **Manage Reactions and Friendships**
  
5. **Verify Database Changes**
   - Confirm that the operations performed via the API are reflected in the MongoDB database by:
     - Checking the formatted JSON response in Insomnia.
     - Verifying the database using a MongoDB GUI like Compass or querying directly.
